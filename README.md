# Digital System Design (DSD)

This repository contains my homework assignments and final project for the **Digital System Design (DSD)** course at **National Taiwan University (NTU), Spring 2025 (113-2)**.  
The projects are implemented in **Verilog**, covering fundamental digital modules, RISC-V CPU design, cache systems, and an advanced final project.
